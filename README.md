# Classes-and-Interfaces
Project from CSS 143 UWB course

1. Fixed any privacy (and other) errors in the previous Classes and Privacy Leaks project code 

2. Modify the Money, Date, and Bill class to implement the Comparable interface. 

3. Modify the Money, Date, and Bill classes to implement the Cloneable interface. Removed any practical use of the copy constructor for Money, Date, and Bill in the rest of the code for clone methods. 

4. Built a class ExpenseAccount that extends my ArrayList. Also implemented Cloneable interface. Removed the limit on the number of bills that can be placed in an account by making my ArrayList dynamically resize itself.

5. Modify Money, Bill, and Date to implement the Serializable interface.
